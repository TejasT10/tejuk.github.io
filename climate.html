  <h2>Geography</h1>
 <p>The total area of the United Kingdom is approximately 243,610 square kilometres (94,060 sq mi). The country occupies the major part of the 
British Isles archipelago and includes the island of Great Britain, the north-eastern one-sixth of the island of Ireland and some smaller
surrounding islands. It lies between the North Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea with the south-east coast coming within 22 miles(35 km) of 
the coast of northern France, from which it is separated by the English Channel. In 1993 10% of the UK was forested, 46% used for pastures
and 25% cultivated for agriculture.</p>
 <p>The United Kingdom has a temperate climate, with plentiful rainfall all year round. The temperature varies with the seasons seldom 
dropping below −11°C or rising above 35°C. Atlantic currents, warmed by the Gulf Stream, bring mild winters and the winters are quite wet.
Heavy snowfall can occur in winter and early spring on high ground. Summers are warmest in the south-east of England, being closest to the 
European mainland, and coolest in the north.</p>
 <p>The United Kingdom lies between latitudes 49° to 61° N, and longitudes 9° W to 2° E. Northern Ireland shares a 224-mile (360 km) land 
boundary with the Republic of Ireland. The coastline of Great Britain is 11,073 miles (17,820 km) long.[133] It is connected to continental
Europe by the Channel Tunnel, which is 31 miles(24 nautical miles) long.The Royal Greenwich Observatory in London is the defining point of 
the Prime Meridian.</p>
