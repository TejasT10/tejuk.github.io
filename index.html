 <p>As we know, the world of ours consists of numerous countries, <i>i.e.</i> small regions of landforms separately administered exsisting
 in this world. Every country is unique in its own aspects, and hence its quite interesting to read about them.</p> 
<p> I, Tejas Shende, a student of class 8, K.V.IIT, Powai, am going to tell you about one of the most influential sovereign states in this 
world, namely <b>the United Kingdom</b>. United Kingdom is a country, most known due to its unmatchable intelligence and supreme power.
United Kingdom, UK in short, has the unique experience of ruling more than half of the world, and was one of the most heavenly powers in 
World War 2. You are going to get more knowledge about this massive state, as you move on with the website.</p>
<p>This document is written in simple english for everyone to understand and is written in an easy-to-understand manner enabling even small
children to know about the UK. Still, if you have any problem in understanding, you can always refer to the sources I have provided. I
would want you to go through the whole document and get to know about UK. Now please begin.</p>
