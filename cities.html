<h2>Geography and Cities</h1>
The total area of the United Kingdom is approximately 243,610 square kilometres (94,060 sq mi). The country occupies the major part of the 
British Isles archipelago and includes the island of Great Britain, the north-eastern one-sixth of the island of Ireland and some smaller
surrounding islands. It lies between the North Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea with the south-east coast coming within 22 miles (35 km) of 
the coast of northern France, from which it is separated by the English Channel. In 1993 10% of the UK was forested, 46% used for pastures
and 25% cultivated for agriculture. The Royal Greenwich Observatory in London is the defining point of the Prime Meridian.
